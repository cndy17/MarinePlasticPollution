# 🌊 Marine Microplastics Dashboard

## 📌 Research Question
**How has the distribution of marine microplastics changed over time, and are there significant patterns by oceanic area?**

## 🌍 Motivation & Relevance
Marine microplastics pose a critical threat to global ecosystems and human health. These tiny plastic particles:

- Harm marine life when ingested
- Enter the human food chain through seafood and water
- Impact global industries such as fisheries and tourism, costing billions annually
- Undermine sustainability goals and marine biodiversity

Understanding the spatial and temporal distribution of microplastics helps policymakers, environmental scientists, and innovators tackle the issue through better regulations and improved waste management solutions.
